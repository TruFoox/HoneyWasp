## About The Project

This is a simple, lightweight, yet powerful bot for Instagram, Youtube, and more! You can automatically post media of your choice, or you can have the bot rip a post off reddit using D3vd's [Meme API](https://github.com/D3vd/Meme_Api)!

A few of our currently available features:
* Manual or Automatic media selection 
* Highly customizable config

## Getting Started

Follow ALL the directions listed below in order for the bot to function correctly. See "Config Help.txt" for more information regarding the config.

### Prerequisites

Before anything, you need to have Python 3 downloaded and installed. [You can download the latest version of Python here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

This program uses a few libraries that might require you to download them if you haven't used them before

* requests
* colorama
* pillow
* numpy

Use this command in the command prompt to download all of the requirements:
```sh
pip install requests colorama pillow numpy
```

### Installation

1. Go to [this URL](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/)
  
2. Press the blue "Generate Access Token" button. It will ask you to log in to your Facebook account, which is required. Make sure you log into whichever Facebook account owns the Instagram account you intend to use.

3. Go to [this URL](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/accesstoken) and input the access token you just generated

4. Press the blue "Debug" button. After the new webpage loads, scroll down to the bottom and press "Extend Access Token"

5. It will give you a different access token, which will last much longer than an ordinary access token. Place the result inside this section of config.json:
```json
"API_Key": "API KEY HERE",
```
Further instruction for how to get your UserID will be added at a later date

## Help

Please DM me on my [bot's Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/dank.ai.memer/) or DM me on Discord (@TruFoox) for questions. I will both assist you there and, if the question is common enough, I will answer it here!

## Usage

This bot generally requires zero input from the user while it is running, but YOU MUST MAKE SURE TO MONITOR WHAT THE BOT POSTS!

If you fail to do so, the bot could post something against Instagram's TOS. This can be minimized, however, by keeping NSFW disabled in the config and only choosing from subreddits with infrequent unmarked NSFW.

## Built With

Programmed entirely in Python3 using the Requests, Colorama, Pillow, and Numpy libraries
