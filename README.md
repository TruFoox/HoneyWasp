# About The Project

This is a simple, lightweight, yet powerful bot for Instagram, Youtube, and soon, more! You can automatically post media of your choice, or you can have the bot automatically take an image off reddit to post using D3vd's [Meme API](https://github.com/D3vd/Meme_Api)!

# Getting Started

Before you can run the bot, you’ll need **Java 23 or higher** installed.

- You can download the latest version of Java from [Oracle’s official site](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or use [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/) for an open-source build.
- After installing, verify it’s working by running:```java -version```
- It should show version `23` or higher.

After you have successfully confirmed you have Java 23+ installed, download the latest HoneyWasp .zip from [here](https://github.com/TruFoox/HoneyWasp/releases/latest). You can launch HoneyWasp by opening Launch.bat on Windows, or Launch.sh on Linux/Mac. 
- Alternatively, you can run the bot by running the command `java -jar HoneyWasp.jar` on any platform (The .bat/sh file just does it automatically).

**You must follow the instructions in [Discord Bot Setup](#discord-bot-setup) before you can use the bot in any capacity**

## Discord Bot Setup

### Prerequisites

- A Discord account
- A Discord server (with permission to add bots) 
- [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

### Step 1: Create Your Application

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Click **"New Application"**
3. Name it, then click **Create**
4. Click your new bot to open its settings
5. In the **Bot** tab in the left panel, → click **Reset Token**, follow the instructions to get your bot's API token
6. Finally, copy the new token it gives you into ```discord_bot_token``` under ``[General_Settings]`` in config.json

### Step 2: Set OAuth2 Permissions

Go to **OAuth2 → URL Generator**:

**Scopes** (ADD BOTH OF THESE):

- `bot`
- `applications.commands`

**Bot Permissions** (ADD BOTH OF THESE):

- `Use Slash Commands`
- `Send Messages`

Copy the generated **invite URL**, paste it into your browser, and invite the bot to your server. You can now use the bot in its most basic form.

To use it with Instagram or YouTube, go to either [Instagram Setup](#instagram-setup) or [YouTube Setup](#youtube-setup) for instructions

## Instagram Setup

### Prerequisites

- A Facebook (Meta) account
- A **Facebook Developer** account: https://developers.facebook.com
- A **Facebook Page**

### Step 1: Set Up Facebook App

1. Go to the Facebook Developer Portal: https://developers.facebook.com/apps/
2. Click **“Create App”**
3. Choose an app name (this doesn't matter) → click **Next**
4. For your **Use Case**, choose **Other**
5. When asked for the app type, choose **Business**
6. Press **Create app**
7. Open your app settings, and in the left panel, go to **Add Product**, find **Instagram**, and click **Set Up**

### Step 2: Link Accounts Properly

1. Make sure your **Instagram account is a Business or Creator account**
2. Link your Instagram account to a **Facebook Page** if it isn't already
    - IG App → Settings → Account → Switch to Professional
    - Facebook Page → Settings → Link Instagram Account

### Step 3: Get Access Token

1. In your app, go to **Tools → Graph API Explorer**
2. Select your app, and under **User or Page** select **Get User Access Token**
3. Under **Permissions**, add:
    - `instagram_basic`
    - `pages_show_list`
    - `publish_video`
    - `instagram_content_publish`
4. Click Generate Access Token, then log in with your Facebook account and authorize access
5. Copy the access token it gives you

### Step 4: Get Long Lived Access Token

1. Go to https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/accesstoken
2. Paste your access token into the box and press **Debug**
3. Scroll down to the bottom and press "Extend Access Token"
4. It will give you a different access token, which will expire in 2 months instead of 1 hour.
5. Place the result inside the ``api_key`` under ``[Instagram_Settings]`` of config.json

## YouTube Setup

### Prerequisites

- A **Google Account**
- Access to the **Google Cloud Console**: https://console.cloud.google.com/
- A **YouTube Channel** linked to your Google Account

### Step 1: Create a Project in Google Cloud

1. Go to the Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Click the project dropdown at the top → **New Project**
3. Name it and click **Create**
4. After it's created, click the project dropdown again → select your new project

### Step 2: Enable YouTube Data API

1. Search for **YouTube Data API** or go [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/youtube.googleapis.com?q=search&referrer=search&inv=1&invt=Ab2WDA&project=agile-falcon-356204)
2. Click on it, then press **Enable**

### Step 3: Set Up OAuth Credentials

1. Go to **APIs & Services → Credentials**
2. Click **Create Credentials → OAuth client ID**
3. If prompted, set up the OAuth consent screen:
    - Go to [this link](https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/audience) (Auth → Audience), and under **Publishing status**, press **Publish App**
    - Go to **APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen**
    - Fill in required fields (app name, support email. These do not matter)
    - Choose **External**, then press **Create**
    - Click **Save and Continue** until you can hit **Back to Dashboard**
5. Under **Create OAuth client ID**, choose **Desktop App**
6. Name it anything → click **Create**
7. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
8. Place the Client ID in ``client_id`` and Client Secret in ``client_secret`` under ``[Youtube_Settings]`` of Config.json

### Step 4: Generate a Refresh Token (One-Time)
1. Open **Launch.exe** in HoneyWasp
2. In the Discord Server where you have the bot, use ``/start youtube``
3. Assuming ``refresh_token`` is empty in the config, the bot will attempt to open your web browser to allow you to retrieve your bot token
4. In this page, first select your Google account, then when prompted about the app being unverified → click **Show Advanced** → click **Go to [YOUR APP'S NAME] (unsafe)**
5. When prompted to allow access to your YouTube account, press **Continue**
6. You can find your access token in the URL, between "http://localhost/?code=" and "&scope=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.upload"
7. Your access token should look something like this: ``4/0AJIL1DDF16...`` (Do not include the "&" before "scope" or the "=" after "code"). Paste it into the console
8. Assuming your token was valid, the console will now give you a new token to put in ``refresh_token`` under ``[Youtube_Settings]`` of Config.json

# Usage
Below you can find information regarding [customizing the config](#the-config) and [using the bot](#starting-and-interacting-with-the-bot)
## The Config
Before launching the bot, make sure `Config.json` is set up correctly.  
All necessary fields (Credentials, API keys, etc.) should already be filled, assuming you followed [Instagram Setup](#instagram-setup), [YouTube Setup](#youtube-setup), or both.  
You can tweak the remaining settings, such as `post_mode`, `caption`, `autostart`, `subreddits`, and more to your preferences. Some may already be filled, but you can delete them, as they are placeholders.

All of the different config items are explained below

### Tips
- The config file is **not** forgiving of typos - what you input is taken literally, so check your spelling
- Boolean values (`true` or `false`) need to be lowercase (e.g., `"debug_mode": true`)
- There MUST be a comma delimiter after every config value
- ALWAYS surround string (non-numeric, non-boolean) values with quotes (e.g., `"caption": "Enjoy this meme"`)
- Do not put anything in `"refresh_token"` under `"Youtube_Settings"` until prompted to do so by the bot

## Starting and Interacting with the bot
To use the bot, launch ``launch.exe`` (You can also launch it using ``/data/start.exe``. launch.exe is just a launcher to make the main directory cleaner)

You can interact with the bot using Discord /slash commands. A list of commands can be found below:
- ``/start [SERVICE/ALL]`` - Start the bot on the specified service
- ``/clear [SERVICE/ALL]`` - Clear the automatic media cache for the specified service (Cache is used to prevent duplicate posts)
- ``/stop [SERVICE/ALL]`` - Stop the bot on the specified service

# Help

## Windows Defender Note
This app might get flagged by Windows Defender because automated programs that call apis can resemble certain types of malware, despite being safe.
If this happens, to use the bot you must allow it

### How to Allow It Through Defender:
- Open Windows Security

- Go to Virus & threat protection

- Click "Protection history"

- Find the blocked app and click "Actions" > "Allow"
